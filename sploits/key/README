Key is a simple XOR cipher against 8 bytes. The 8 corresponding bytes, which
equal the cipher bytes XORed with 0x77, comprise the key.

The stored bytes are:
d68633c196b4eddc

Making the key: a1f144b6e1c39aab

The solution is:

echo -n $'\xa1\xf1\x44\xb6\xe1\xc3\x9a\xab' | ./hsvm key

And the flag is the same as they key: a1f144b6e1c39aab

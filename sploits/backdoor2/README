Backdoor2 is the same as backdoor with two changes:
	1) Shellcode must be XORed with 0x99
	2) Characters 0x00 and 0x0a are disallowed

Constraint 2 will force the attacker to create shellcode while will work under
the restriction of common C string operations.

This is easily accomplished with a 2-stage exploit. The first stage meets
constraint 2 and copies the real payload into memory before jumping to it. The
payload must meet constraints only imposed by the first stage (loader).

The hashing algorithm in sum can be solved with a SAT solver. Make no mistake,
it's quite a doozy.

I had no luck with the z3 solver. STP saved the day. solve.smt will be accepted
by z3, solve.stp.smt will be solved by STP. STP solved this problem in 1 hour,
45 minutes. z3 ran through the night and did not solve the problem.

time ./stp --simplifying-minisat -s --SMTLIB2 solve.stp.smt

The following inputs will result in a sum of 0x0000000000000000:
0x4A42 0x8B9C 0xF40C 0x8CCD
This means the correct input is: 4a428b9cf40c8ccd

Many bothans died to bring us this information.

Backdoor is a simple program which reads in shellcode and then jumps directly
to the shellcode. The shellcode must contain three components:

	The five byte sequence {'k', 'n', 'o', 'c', 'k'}
	The actual shellcode absent byte 0x99
	Byte 0x99 to signal the end of shellcode

Execution will begin at address 0x8000, something for the player to keep in
mind.
